How do I Interpret user needs and implemenet them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
- I believe that to interpret user needs, you need to break them down the base level. For example, if users want in-depth customizable profile options then you first need to start from the very beginning and create your user stories that way. Slowly build up, brick by brick to eventually build the entire house. User stories act like bricks in building the house, having the ability to break down the big desires and needs of users into small segments.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- Normally, I approach developing programs with a similar approach to user stories. I like to start at the base level and work my way up to the more complicated portions of a program. Without a solid base, you are doomed to fail so I like to start there. I beleive that is part of the reason why I like agile so much.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- I believe communicating efficiently and appropriately goes a long way to being a good team member in any team setting. Especially with using an agile approach, your team relies on communication so heavily that any team member that isn't communicating effectively they are making things harder for the rest of the team.
